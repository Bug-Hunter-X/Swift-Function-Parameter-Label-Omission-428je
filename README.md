This repository demonstrates a common Swift coding error: omitting a function parameter label when calling a function that requires it.

The `bug.swift` file shows the incorrect code that causes a compiler error. The `bugSolution.swift` demonstrates the correct way to call the function by including the parameter labels.  This is crucial for code readability and maintainability.
